PHP Client Library for the AffiniPay Payment Gateway

## Installation

Download the PHP client library:

    git clone git://github.com/charge-io/chargeio-php.git

To use the library in your application, add the following to your PHP script:

    require_once '/path/to/chargeio-php/lib/ChargeIO.php';

### Set up ChargeIO credentials
The library's APIs require credentials to access your merchant data on the AffiniPay servers. You
can either:

- Provide credentials as arguments to each API call.
- Configure the library with default credentials.

  To set default credentials, call ChargeIO::setCredentials with an AffiniPay_Credentials object. The AffiniPay_Credentials object is instantiated with a public_key and a secret_key.

    ChargeIO::setCredentials(new AffiniPay_Credentials('<public_key>', '<secret_key>'));

### Using AffiniPay hosted fields to create a charge token
You must tokenize all sensitive payment information before you submit it to AffiniPay. On your
payment form, use AffiniPayâ€™s hosted fields to secure payment data and call
window.AffiniPay.HostedFields.getPaymentToken to create a one-time payment token. See
["Creating payment forms using hosted fields"](https://developers.affinipay.com/collect/create-payment-form-hosted-fields.html). Then, POST the payment token ID to your PHP script.

### Making a charge
Pass an amount and the one-time token ID returned from your payment page to complete a charge.

```
    $amount = $_POST['amount'];
    $token_id = $_POST['token_id'];
    $charge = ChargeIO_Charge::create(new ChargeIO_PaymentMethodReference(array('id' => $token_id)), $amount);
```
